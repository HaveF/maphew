testing bazaar as a tool to edit and commit to svn repos.

Ok, so the process appears to be:

- bzr pull
- do stuff
- bzr commit (to local mirror)
- do stuff
- bzr commit (to local mirror)
- all good for public consumption?
- bzr push (note: no chance for new comment, uses ones previous local commits)

and it works!
