Hi Ryan,

I haven't managed to get around to finishing up the documentation yet.
I will be happy to share everything I have, just be forewarned that
it will probably take some detective work to figure out how to apply
to your data. :)

Our base data, 1:50k NTDB, is arranged in an ArcInfo library. There
are just over 750 tiles for our area arranged in a major/minor 
directory scheme:
http://renres.gov.yk.ca/pubs/rrgis/data/50kshade.html

	arcdata\50k\base\105d\105d01
	...
	arcdata\50k\base\105d\105d16
	arcdata\50k\base\115a\115a01
	...
	arcdata\50k\base\115a\115a16
	...

Each on of those tile dirs in turn hold the base data coverages 
(contours, watercourses, etc).


	115a01\qctr		/* contours
	115a01\qwtc		/* watercourses
	115a01\qwtb		/* waterbodies
	...

I duplicated the dir structure, but not contents, on a development
drive on the local machine. From this point forward all work happens
on the dev drive. I assume you are using ArcInfo and Topogrid or
ANUDEM.


Quick Methodolgy Outline
========================

Prepwork:
---------

-take the shorelines of all the major waterbodies where elevation is
known and turn them into waterbody contours. This works much better
than using them as polygons and lattice-replacing the elevation 
values. See 
http://renres.gov.yk.ca/pubs/rrgis/techweb/pages/dev/nrcan-vs-rrgis_warning.html

-our waterbody coverages were already edge matched across tile 
 boundaries so I didn't need to worry about that

-didn't even attempt to edge match contours. The final dems indicate
 it was necessary either (for our data, yours maybe different).

-didn't edge match watercourses. This only caused problems in a few
 areas.

-Create a 1km & 100m buffer polys around the neatline of each tile
 (stored as $dev\105d\105d03\buf_1k). The 1km buffer is used as  
 Areas of Interest for the dem calculations, then the final
 dem is clipped to the 100m buffer. This helps eliminate the majority
 of the edge effects.

-identify which tiles intersect the buffers, keep record of their 
 names

-merge and clip the source coverages (contour, watercourse & waterbody)
 to the 1km buffer. Note there are two waterbody coverages: one is
 waterbody as polygons with no elevation values, and the other is
 waterbody shoreline as contours with elevation values.

-generate all of the dems in whatever projection they will finally 
 be used in. Reprojecting dems results in spurious values along the 
 edges which can cause problems with some software. Now is the time
 to project the source data if you need to.


DEM Work:
---------

-build coarse dem using 300-500m cells for stream flipping (which size
 of cell depends on the speed of your machine and the resolution of
 your data. These coarse dems should not take a long time to build. A
 couple of minutes at the most.)
  + no drainage enforcement
  + only contours used

-create shaded relief images of each dem and examine for gross source
 data errors (eg. contours with obviously out of range elevations)

-use 300m dem to flip streams so that they are hydrologically correct
 (meaning the first coordinate pair is upslope from the last)

-build 30-100m dems with drainage enforcement turned on, using contours
 and watercourses. If 30m takes to long use a larger cell size. This 
 step may have to be repeated several times so no need to take too
 much time.

-create relief images and examine for evidence of streams which still
 run uphill - they look excessively deep box canyons. Manually flip
 the recalcitrant ones.

-rinse, lather, repeat until clean

-create (what you hope is) the final dem at the final resolution
 using all the data.
  + contours
  + flipped watercourses
  + waterbodies as polygons
  + waterbodies as contours
  + drainage enforcement turned on

-examine shaded relief for anomalies. At this point I burned up a
 whole roll of paper by plotting all of the shaded relief images at
 1:100k. You can see much more at a glance on a piece of paper than 
 on a monitor. Sometimes I found errors I might not otherwise have
 recgonized.  We also hired a contractor to go through the all of 
 the test plots looking for problems. By this point in the project
 I was often seeing what I wanted to be there rather than what was. :)

-rinse, lather, repeat until clean.


Finishing up:
-------------

-clip dems & shaded relief to 100m buffer. This allows a 3 cell 
 overlap between adjacent tiles for seamless coverage. Place in 
 core data repository.

-merge and clip the flipped watercourses and fixed contours back
 into the core data repository


Notes:
------

Although we have them, I did not use Spot Elevations in the dems. 
Our initial tests showed they introduced anomalies more often than 
not. This decision needs to be revisited though because our testing 
was done at 1:250k and the story may be different with 50k data.

We used Topogrid for the first half of this project and then switched
to Anudem . It should be possible to use Tgrid all the way but I 
found Anudem to be faster and more reliable. It also gives you a 
little more flexibility. It is a pain to export the Arc data out to 
Anudem though.

You can have all the AMLs I wrote to make this happen but be forewarned,
I am not a programmer and have no training. Before starting this project 
I had not written any AML scripts. So they are messy, not well thought 
out, of greatly varying quality and stability, and unlikely to be very
portable. All the same if they will help you, you are welcome to them.

Read the Docs for Tgrid/Anudem. Then read them again. and again. I
had to go through them several times before I was able to fully absorb
everything. This was made abundantly clear when I complained to 
ESRI tech support and the author of Anudem, on seperate occasions,
and they calmy replied 'RTFM, page x'.

Selecting a cell size too small for your data leads to worse results.
On the DEM Comparision web page mentioned above, this is the primary
cause of the ripples and wavelets across the low relief areas.


These webpages on our website contain some more information which may
be useful:

A quick & dirty run through my bookmarks yields:

So there you go. Best of luck and let me know how it works out.
In the event you find some of my scripts worth using and fixing, 
please email the changes back to me.

cheers,
